"""Request Desk — an app that decides what you may do from who Launchpad says you are.

The whole point of this app is the seam. Launchpad answers one question —
*who is looking at this page* — and answers it with an identity the app cannot
forge: the browser's request arrives carrying a blob the platform signed, the
app relays it back, and the platform resolves it against the real principal.
Everything after that is the app's own business, and here that business is an
embedded SQLite database holding a directory of people, two groups, and the
requests those people file.

    Launchpad                          this app
    ─────────                          ────────
    email, name, role, groups   ──▶    directory lookup on the address
                                       ──▶ desk group membership
                                           ──▶ submit / see all / decide

**Three sources of authority, deliberately not one.**

*The platform's role on the app* — owner, editor, or an administrator of the
install — is used for exactly one thing: administering the desk. Somebody has
to be able to add the first person to an empty directory, and that somebody is
whoever Launchpad already trusts with the deployment. It is never used for
approving a request, because "may redeploy this app" is not "may approve an
expense" and an app that conflates them has invented an authority nobody
granted.

*A desk group an editor put you in* is the ordinary path, and the one the
directory page is for.

*A desk group linked to a Launchpad group* is the same thing with the platform
doing the bookkeeping — put the finance team in the `finance` group once, and
every desk that links to it follows.

**The address is the identity.** Launchpad withholds the email address from an
app whose visibility is `public` — a public app's visitors did not consent to
being on a list by visiting — so this app must not be public. It says so on the
page rather than looking broken, which is the honest failure and the one worth
demonstrating.
