"""The desk itself: an embedded SQLite database and the rule that reads it.

This module knows nothing about Launchpad and imports nothing from it. It takes
a :class:`Caller` — an address, a name, a role and a list of directory group
names — and answers what that person may do here. That separation is the point
of the app rather than a tidiness preference: the platform is the authority on
*who is looking*, and this file is the authority on *what that person may do*,
and neither can quietly become the other.

It is also what makes the rule testable without a running install. `test_desk.py`
constructs callers by hand.

**Everything is keyed on the email address**, lowercased and stripped. An
editor adds a person by address and name; the platform later says an address;
the two meet here. A person whose address is not in the directory is not
refused rudely — they are simply nobody this desk knows, which is a state the
page can explain and an editor can fix in one field.
